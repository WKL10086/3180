1. Provide example code and necessary elaborations for demonstrating the advantages of Dynamic Scoping in using Perl to implement the advanced horse-racing game as compared to the corresponding codes in Python.

Since dynamic scoping would use the most recent definition of a variable, the code would be more flexible. For example, if the variable $AdvancedHorse::delta_speed is defined in the AdvancedHorse package (which is -1), and then redefined in a subroutine (which is 4 in the above picture), the subroutine would use the most recent definition of $AdvancedHorse::delta_speed. It allow the code to be more flexible, and we don't need to pass the variable as a parameter like in Python which is more tedious.

In Python, we would need to pass the variable as a parameter in order to hover the default value (global variable value) of the variable.. For example, in the above picture, we would need to pass the variable delta_speed as a parameter to the function, which is more tedious.

2. Explain how the keyword local has been used in your assignment code. In particular, its role and effect.

The keyword local in Perl is used to declare a dynamic scoping variable. It can redefined the variable which declare in lexical scope. For example, in the above picture, the variable $AdvancedHorse::delta_speed is originally defined in the AdvancedHorse package (which is -1), and then redefined in a subroutine (which is 4 in the above picture), the subroutine would use the most recent definition of $AdvancedHorse::delta_speed. 
It allow us to redefined the variable in the other place which is more flexible.
