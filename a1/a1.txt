Heap-dynamic variable 
Pro: flexible and Storage efficiency
Con: Runtiime speed efficiency and Reliability

Runtiime speed efficiency:
Compare with static variable, dynamic memory variable need to allocate memory from heap in runtime, which is time consuming.
Moreover, dynamic memory variable need to free memory in runtime, which is also time consuming.
On the other hand, static variable is allocated in compile time, which is faster than dynamic memory variable.

Reliability:
Heap-dynamic variable need to deallocate memory manually, which is error-prone and cause memory leak if not handled properly. 

If we create object on stack, it will be destroyed automatically when the function is finished. It frees us from the burden of memory management.
