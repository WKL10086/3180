            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Teemo makes burgers for a living.</p>
            <p>In this assignment, we are going to write a C++ program to simulate a few days at the <i>Happy Teemo Burgers</i> proudly owned by him.</p>
            <p>The main objectives of this relatively simple assignment are three-fold, for you:
                </p><ul>
                    <li>To have a taste of a CSCI3180 assignment, in particular, its styles, policies, and submission system.</li>
                    <li>To practice C++ programming which will be used in the next assignment as well.</li>
                    <li>To explore the pros and cons of explicit heap-dynamic variables (i.e. usage of heap-dynamic memory).</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Task overview &amp; download</h2>
            <p>You have two main tasks in this assignment.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, download the starting skeleton code <a href="http://course.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~csci3180/assignments/assignment1/downloads/a1-starting-code.zip">HERE</a>. Please download it now, as we may refer to it in the description below. Most functions have already been completed for you. Your programming task is to read the description, understand the given code, and complete the 3 incomplete functions marked with TODO in the given skeleton code files. You only need to modify and submit two files: <b>bun.cpp</b> and <b>burgerShop.cpp</b>. Basically, all other files should not be submitted or modified. We will provide the specifics in the <a href="http://course.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~csci3180/assignments/assignment1/#submission">Submission &amp; deadline</a> section.</li>
                <li>Write a report on heap-dynamic memory pros/cons, and save it as a PDF file. We will talk about it in details after the programming task description.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Read the pinned assignment 1 FAQ post on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/lb640zoes506ma">Piazza</a> for some common clarifications. You should check that a day before the deadline to make sure you don't miss any clarifications, even if you have already submitted your work then.</p>
            <p>If you need further clarifications of the requirements, please feel free to post on the Piazza with the <u>assignment1</u> tag. However, to avoid cluttering the forum with repeated/trivial questions, please do read all the given code, webpage description, sample output, and latest FAQ carefully before posting your questions. Also, please be reminded that we won't debug for any student's assignment for the sake of fairness and that you should not share/post your solution code anywhere.</p>

        <div id="ingredient">
            <h2>The Ingredient class</h2>
            
            <div class="block">
            <p>It is the abstract base class (ABC) for burger ingredients. We only have 3 classes in this class hierarchy and <code>Ingredient</code> sits at the top. To give you an overview of the class design, here is the class diagram:</p>
            <img src="./CSCI3180 Assignment 1_files/class-diagram-1.png"> 
            <p>In the diagram, <code>+</code> denotes the public members while <code>-</code> denotes the private members.</p>
            <p>Details will be provided below. For anything that appears to be unclear to you, you should refer to the given code if they are available. First, let's look at this ABC: the <code>Ingredient</code> class.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Data members</h3>

            <div class="block">
                <pre class=" language-cpp"><code class=" language-cpp"><span class="token keyword">int</span> freshness <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">100</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
                <p>This is the freshness of the ingredient. It is always set to 100 initially and will decrease by 1 per update, which will be described later.</p>
            </div>

                <p>This is the destructor. It doesn't really do anything in this class, but as a good practice we should always declare it virtual in an ABC. If you are curious why, think about what may happen if the base class destructor is not virtual when we delete a derived class object via a base class pointer.</p>

                <p>Every hour in our simulation, the <code>update</code> function of all ingredients will be called to update their states. For all ingredients, their freshness values have to each be decreased by 1 (lower-bound by 0). For specific ingredients, the <code>update</code> function may be overridden to specify additional state updates required.</p>

                <p>Well, finally, it is time to make burgers!</p>
                <p>The challenge is, our beloved customers have specific requests on exactly how their burgers should be made, as specified by <code>requiredBunSoftness</code> and <code>requiredMeatDoneness</code>.</p>
                <p>Teemo follow these rules strictly (and so will you ;)):
                    </p><ul>
                        <li>A Happy Teemo Burger uses exactly 1 <i>suitable</i> meat and 2 <i>suitable</i> buns. If we cannot gather from the storage all those 3 specific ingredients for a burger, the function will simply return false.</li>
                        <li>Regarding what the <i>suitable</i> ingredients are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Spoiled ingredients should never be used. By the way, they just stay in the storage forever because Teemo is apparently too busy. Don't help him to remove those spoiled stuff yourself.</li>
                                <li>A <i>suitable</i> meat must have at least <code>requiredMeatDoneness</code> of doneness.</li>
                                <li>A <i>suitable</i> bun must have at least <code>requiredBunSoftness</code> of softness.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>When looking for each of those 3 ingredients, Teemo simply always picks the first <i>suitable</i> meat and first two <i>suitable</i> buns from the storage - i.e. technically, the smaller the array index the better for each of them.</li>
                        <li>After we have found the 3 <i>suitable</i> ingredients, we do the following to actually craft and serve the burger:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Remove the used ingredients from the storage. That means you should dynamically deallocate the 1 dynamic <code>Meat</code> object and the 2 dynamic <code>Bun</code> objects, and then for each of them set the corresponding <code>ingredientStorage[i]</code> to <code>nullptr</code> indicating that the originally-occupied storage slot is now empty and thus reusable later for new ingredients.</li>
                                <li>Since 3 ingredients have been used, decrease <code>ingredientStorageUsed</code> by 3.</li>
                                <li>Add 1 to <code>burgerServed</code> as our now-satisfied customer walks away with our burger happily.</li>
                                <li>Return true.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p>You need to implement this function.</p>

            <h2>Sample output &amp; grading</h2>
            <p>Your finished program should produce the same output as our <a href="http://course.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~csci3180/assignments/assignment1/downloads/sample.txt">sample output</a>. Please note that sample output, naturally, does not show all possible cases. It is part of the assessment for you to design your own test cases to test your program making sure it works in all scenarios per our description. Be reminded to remove any debugging message that you might have added before submitting your code as program grading is <b>automatic and purely output-based</b>.</p>
            <p>For this assignment, we will also check if your program has any memory leak. We will be using the following command to compile and run your program under the "Test environment" we mentioned in tutorial 1, assuming your source files are located at "csci3180/a1".</p>
            <blockquote><code>g++ -std=c++20 -fsanitize=address,leak -o main csci3180/a1/*.cpp &amp;&amp; ./main</code></blockquote>
            <p>It will report detected memory leak as runtime errors when you run the program (i.e. extra output indicating that there is a memory leak). If you want to learn about it, you may read <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html">this manual</a>. With this said, we will still try to grade your program output (without leak checking, that is, with command <code>g++ -std=c++20 -o main csci3180/a1/*.cpp &amp;&amp; ./main</code>) after applying some mark penalty even if there is a memory leak detected, so do your best in other tasks anyway if memory leak is too hard to fix for you. Please note that, on the other hand, if your program cannot even be compiled or simply crashes on our grading environment, no mark can be given. Be aware that C++ programs may behave differently in different environments. For grading, we will only consider your program output on our grading machine using the official grading environment. Therefore, while you are free to work out your solution in any environment, <b>do test it in our official grading environment and by all means avoid compilation errors and crashes</b> before your submit your work. Program stability is king.</p>

            <h2>Written report</h2>
            <p>Write a report to comment on the pros and cons of heap-dynamic variables (i.e. usage of heap-dynamic memory) in one PDF file named exactly <b>a1.pdf</b>, with at most four A4 pages, containing two main sections:</p>

                <li>Disadvantages of using heap-dynamic variables</li>

            <p>For each of these, your explanation and examples <b>must be based on the design and code of this assignment</b>. However, you don't need to restrict yourself to use only the current assignment design and written code - you can suggest a modified/extended design or hypothetical scenarios in the context of this assignment. For example, you can do a what-if analysis on using a stack-dynamic variable (<code>Ingredient ingredientStorage[10];</code>) instead of a heap-dynamic variable (<code>Ingredient** ingredientStorage</code>) for representing the ingredient storage in this assignment.</p>
