            <h1>Task 1: Greedy Snake</h1>
            <p>This is a small programming exercise for you to get familiar with Python, which is a dynamically typed language. In this task, you have to strictly follow our proposed OO design and the game rules for "Greedy Snake" stated in this section.</p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Greedy Snake is a single-player game. When the game starts, the player uses the 4 keys ('w', 'a', 's', and 'd') to move a snake around the board, represented by a 22 x 22 map. <code>After inputing the keys, you should press the “Enter" key to proceed.</code> If the key 'w' is pressed, the snake will move up in the next step. If the key 's' is pressed, the snake will move down in the next step. If the key 'a' is pressed, the snake will move left in the next step. If the key 'd' is pressed, the snake will move right in the next step. If you press any of the keys other than these four, the snake will move right by default.</p>
            <p>As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows longer. We have two different kinds of food here (i.e., apple and water) and each food has a <code>base score</code> (equals to 100), while the <code>actual score</code> the snake can obtain from the food is determined by the food attributes.
             Specifically, the score of an apple is determined by its <code>maturity</code>. If it is mature, then the actual score is equal to the base score. Otherwise, the actual score would be 0. The score of water is determined by its <code>volume</code>, which is equal to the <code>volume * base score</code>. The final score obtained by the player is calculated based on the number and the type of food your snake ate. 
        The game ends when the snake either crashes into a wall or moves into itself. The goal is to make the snake grow up to the maximum length (set as 15 by default). This means you win the game.  </p>
            
            <h2>Preparation</h2>

            <h2>Input Specification</h2>
            <p>In this exercise, you are required to use command line to get input information. There is only one thing requiring user-input, which is the moving direction of the snake. Input one of the pre-defined 4 keys ('w', 'a', 's', and 'd') and press "Enter" to control the direction.</p>          
            <img src="./CSCI3180 Assignment 2_files/input.png">

            <h2>Move and Display Game Information</h2>
                <p>The snake always starts from the top-left corner of the board. You can use 4 keys ('w', 'a', 's', and 'd') on the keyboard to control the movement of the snake ('w' means up, 's' means down, 'a' means left, 'd' means right. Right is the default value.). If an invalid key (a key not in the 4 pre-defined keys) is pressed, the snake will move to the right by default.</p>
                <p>After each movement, the current score obtained by the player will be printed on the board.</p>
                <p>The snake's head and body are represented by '@' and '*', respectively. 'o' represents the apple and '!' means water. The boundary is represented by '#'.</p>
                <img src="./CSCI3180 Assignment 2_files/display_1.png">

            <h2>Game End</h2>
            <p>You lose the game and the game is over when the snake either crashes into a wall or moves into itself.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, you win if your snake grows up to the maximum length, which is set as 15 by default.</p>

            <h2>Class Design for Basic Functions in Python</h2>
            <p>Please follow the classes defined below in your implementation. You are not allowed to add any class variables, class methods, or classes. We will start the program with <code>python greedySnake.py</code>. The following class design uses the naming convention of Python. In particular, underscored variables are private. You are also required to use property decorator for several attributes in your Python implementation. Please accomplish all tasks marked with TODO in the provided Python template.</p>

            <h3>The Food class</h3> <!-- Food -->
            <p>It is the base class for all kinds of things that a snake can eat. We only have 3 classes in this class hierarchy and <code>Food</code> sits at the top. To give you an overview of the class design, here is the class diagram:</p>

            <h1>Task 2: Demonstrating Advantages of Dynamic Typing</h1>
            Dynamic typing is an important characteristic of Python. It has many commonly-claimed advantanges:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Don’t need to declare variables or their data type before assignment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It makes functions more reusable because functions can be applied on arguments of different types.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ...
                </li>
                
            </ol>
            However, type checking can only be carried out at runtime, incurring time overhead and reliability issues.

            <p>Please provide at least one concise example code with explanation in the context of this assignment to demonstrate the advantages of Dynamic Typing and at least one concise example code with explanation in the context of this assignment to demonstrate the disadvantages of Dynamic Typing.

            <h1>Task 3: Duck Typing</h1>
            <p>In this task, you are required to implement another new class <code>SnakeCatcher</code>. After this exercise, you may have a deeper understanding of a special feature of Python called <b>Duck Typing</b> that is available only in dynamically-typed programming languages. Also, the C++ code for this new class is provided (<code>greedySnake_enhanced.cpp</code>) and you have to reimplement the new class in Python (a skeleton provided in <code>greedySnake_enhanced.py</code>) based on the following description and the given functions.</p>
            <h2>Duck Typing</h2>
            <p>The following synopsis of Duck Typing is summarized from:
            </p><ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducktyping">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducktyping</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/making-ruby-quack-why-we-love-duck-typing">http://www.sitepoint.com/making-ruby-quack-why-we-love-duck-typing</a></li>
            </ul>
            In standard statically-typed object-oriented languages, objects’ classes (which determine an object’s characteristics and behavior) are essentially interpreted as the objects’ types. Duck Typing is a new typing paradigm in dynamically-typed (late binding) languages that allow us to dissociate typing from objects’ characteristics. It can be summarized by the following motto by the late poet James Whitcombe Riley:
            <span><blockquote><i>When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.</i></blockquote></span>

            
            The basic premise of Duck Typing is simple. If an entity looks, walks, and quacks like a duck, for all intents and purposes it is fair to assume that one is dealing with a member of the species anas platyrhynchos. In practical Python terms, this means that it is possible to try calling any method on any object, regardless of its class. An important advantage of Duck Typing is that we can enjoy polymorphism without inheritance. An immediate consequence is that we can write more generic codes which are cleaner and more precise.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            The game is getting harder! It's not easy for a snake to grow up smoothly since there exist snake catchers in the world (indicated by 'x' in the game)! They can cause harm to the snake. In our extended game, we only have one snake catcher in the environment at each step. The snake catcher is going to appear randomly on the board, and has an active area (a 2x2 square region). The player is supposed to control the heading direction of the snake to prevent it from crashing into the snake catcher. Otherwise, the total score obtained by the player is deducted by 100! The snake catcher's position changes randomly when the snake came into it or after a fixed time interval (20 steps).

            <h2>Displaying Game Information</h2>
            <p> After each movement, the updated information, which consists of the current score obtained by the player, the food information and the position information of the snake catcher should be printed. You are required to implement the new class and ensure the correct information output.</p>

                            </li><li>The files will be added to the "Attached files" list. Please <b>check carefully their filenames</b>. They must be exactly the same as the ones specified. Wrongly named files won't be graded as most grading are automatic.
                            </li><li>Click the blue "Submit" button at the bottom of the page.</li>
                            <li>Now you <b>must verify</b> all of your submitted files by downloading them back and make sure they are your own and the latest version. You can download each of the files with the download button <img style="margin:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:middle;" src="./CSCI3180 Assignment 2_files/download.png">. Click "Start New" to submit again if you need to modify your submission.

                    <li>You can submit as many times as you want, but <b>only the latest submission attempt will be graded</b>. You do NOT get to choose which version we grade.</li>
                    <li>If you submit after the deadline, late penalty will be applied according to the submission time of your last submission attempt.</li>
                    <li><b>Submit early to avoid any last-minute problem.</b> Only Blackboard submissions will be accepted. Again, you can submit as many times as you want, so you may make an early submission first well before the deadline, and update it later.</li>
                    <li>Late submission penalty is 1 point per 5-minutes late. Less than 5-minutes late is considered as a full 5-minutes late. However, your score will be lower-bound by 0 after any mark deduction.</li>
