Advantages of Dynamic Typing: (one example code) 
1. no need to declare types variables or their data type before assignment 
2. polymorphism
3. reduce the amount of code base, efficient


Donâ€™t need to declare variables or their data type before assignment.
It makes functions more reusable because functions can be applied on arguments of different types.
...
However, type checking can only be carried out at runtime, incurring time overhead and reliability issues.

Disadvantages of Dynamic Typing: (one example code)
1. no type checking at compile time


Advantages of Duck Typing: (two example codes and compare with C++)
